## Security Rules
Security rules are rules you can set to determine who is allowed to access a certain resource
for example to allow all users across the internet to access a http server an inbound rule of
0.0.0.0/0 must be set for both https and http.

Where as if you had a server with a specific task i.e running a remote installation of jenkins
you may want to allow that to only be accessible from a specific ip address.
